# AtoutScript > userscripts

A repository of [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) developed to improve UX on various websites.

Unless explicited otherwise, they have been developed, tested, validated and used on the latest version of [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) at the time of the commit.

Issues are to be expected when using them with another version of Tampermonkey, another userscripts extension or another web browser.
